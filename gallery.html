<h2> Final Project</h2>
<h4>Social Cause: Factory farming in the United States. The concept for this podcast is to highlight the fact that the United States is one of the richest countries, and yet we have such low quality food and a food system that promotes animal cruelty. Bellow is a Raster image I created using Adobe Illustrator that is promoting eating natural foods rather than processed foods. Click the following link for more information on Factory Farming .
